# Simple-ATM-Machine-stimulation
This is a Python program to simulate a basic ATM machine. The program will allow users to perform transactions such as checking the balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. The program will utilize for and while loops, along with break and continue statements, to control the transaction flow.

## The ATM will allow the user to:
- Check their account balance.
- Withdraw money from their account.
- Deposit money into their account.
- Exit the ATM system.

## Working method:
1. The ATM machine will with an initial balance of $500.
2. It Allows the user to select an option from a menu of available actions.
3. Then, it processes the user's selection and executes the corresponding transaction.
4. It repeats the process until the user decides to exit the ATM by selecting the appropriate option.

## Example:
``` python
Welcome to the ATM
1. Check Balance
2. Withdraw Money
3. Deposit Money
4. Exit
Please select an option (1-4): 2
Enter the amount to withdraw: $200
$200 has been withdrawn. Your new balance is $300.
